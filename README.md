# distributed-coding-demo

This repo contains MATLAB live scripts for interactive visualization of data from Steinmetz et al., (2019): [Distributed coding of choice, action and engagement across the mouse brain](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1787-x). These data contain electrophysiological recordings of neuronal activity across the mouse brain while the animals are engaged in a perceptual decision-making task. Data is aggregated across multiple [Neuropixel probes](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/neuropixels/)  inserted at various brain locations across multiple animals.
